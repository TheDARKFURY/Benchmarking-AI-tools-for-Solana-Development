# Benchmarking AI Tools for Solana Smart Contract Development

AI adoption in software development is surging — 50% of developers now use it daily, a stunning leap from almost none just two years ago. Tools powered by generic AI models are improving rapidly, generating code at blazing speeds. The blockchain developer community has embraced this wave, exploring AI for building smart contracts and dApps. However, at Solana Breakpoint, many developers shared that while they’ve experimented with AI tools, they often haven’t stuck with them.

This raises a critical question:

**How useful are existing AI tools for blockchain developers?**

## Study Overview

We conducted a systematic analysis to evaluate the capabilities of AI tools in generating secure, functional Solana dApps. The scope was limited to the Solana blockchain, focusing on Vanilla/Native programs and those using the Anchor framework. Solana’s high-performance architecture places a premium on efficient program design, making this a rigorous test of AI tools.

We tested popular widely used AI tools directly or through applications leveraging them. Our experiments were guided by predefined prompts and evaluated against a consistent set of criteria.

## Methodology

### Use Cases
We tested 2 specific Solana program scenarios, each described with highly detailed prompts to minimize variability caused by prompt quality. One example:

#### Prompt Example:
> Create a Solana program that implements an escrow system for exchanging tokens between two parties. It should allow:
> - **Offer creation**: Transfer tokens to a temporary account controlled by a PDA.
> - **Offer acceptance**: Exchange tokens securely between parties.
> - **Offer closure**: Return tokens to the initiating party if the offer isn't accepted.
>
> The program should include account validation, proper PDA usage, and robust security checks.

### Evaluation Criteria
We assessed the generated programs on:
- **Project structure and code compilation success**
- **Functionality and correctness of instructions**
- **Security checks and adherence to best practices**
- **Optimization for compute units and CPI calls**
- **Dependency management and up-to-date standards**

## Key Findings

1. **Inconsistent Code Compilation**
   - None of the tools consistently produced compilable code on the first attempt.
   - Manual intervention was often required to correct syntax errors, account misconfigurations, or outdated dependencies.

2. **Inadequate Security Checks**
   - Many tools omitted critical security measures such as signer verification, ownership validation, and handling unchecked arithmetic operations.
   - Generated code often defaulted to insecure patterns.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Accounts and Instructions**
   - Mismanagement of Solana-specific elements like Pubkeys and AccountInfo objects was common.
   - Accounts requiring mutability were frequently not marked, leading to execution errors.

4. **Outdated Dependencies**
   - AI-generated programs often relied on deprecated or incorrect libraries, reflecting a lack of alignment with Solana's evolving standards.

5. **Confusion Between Rust and TypeScript**
   - Tools occasionally mixed Rust and TypeScript code, resulting in irrelevant or unusable outputs.

6. **Lack of Secure PDA Handling**
   - Critical Solana elements like PDAs were often mishandled, exposing programs to potential exploits.

## Example Issues

- **Compilation Errors**:
  - Missing or incorrect imports (e.g., undeclared types like `EscrowError`).
  - Misconfigured account context structs.

- **Security Gaps**:
  - Accounts not validated as signers.
  - Missing ownership checks for token accounts.

- **Account Mismanagement**:
  - Temporary accounts not marked as mutable.
  - Confusion between AccountInfo and Pubkey types.

## Conclusion

AI tools generate impressive results at first glance, delivering speed and convenience. However, their shortcomings in producing reliable, secure Solana programs highlight the need for specialized AI models tailored to blockchain development. Without tailored tools, blockchain developers face significant risks, as even small errors in smart contracts can lead to substantial financial losses.

**Developers should proceed with caution** when using generic AI tools for blockchain. Until AI is specifically trained for Web3's unique demands, manual review and rigorous testing will remain essential.

## Future Outlook

Our benchmarking study underscores the gap between generic AI tools and the specialized needs of blockchain developers. To bridge this gap:
- **AI tools must be fine-tuned for blockchain ecosystems.**
- **Collaboration between AI researchers and blockchain developers is crucial.**
- **Security and compliance must be a top priority for AI-generated code.**

Stay tuned for further updates as we explore advancements in AI for Web3 development.
