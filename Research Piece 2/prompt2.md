Create an auction program in solana that allows users to bid on items using SPL tokens. The program works by creating an auction account that is bound to a resource. The auction account contains information about the auction, such as the start time, end time, and the current highest bid. Users can place bids on the auction by sending a transaction to the program. The program will then update the auction account with the new bid. Once the auction ends, the program will transfer the SPL tokens from the winning bidder to the seller.
